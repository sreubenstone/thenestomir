### What is The Nestomir?

The Nestomir is a planetary quest (fantasy novel and companion app) involving a crash-landed alien warrior, a troubled 12-year-old boy, a mysterious learning force permeating the universe and 9 computer science lessons which grant students superpowers. It follows the main character, Jake Addison, through a series of quests which introduce him to computer programming and a new "learn with purpose" learning philosophy. **And now through crowd participation, we're going to improve the the story and social reading driven app experience together.**

### On Github

- Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes made to a project over time
- GitHub is a web-based hosting platform for version control repositories; it uses Git technology to store and manage repositories
- A pull request is a way for a developer (or writer 😉) to suggest changes to a project. By creating a pull request, the developer (or writer) is asking the repository owner (in our case, The Nestomir team) to review and consider incorporating their changes into the main branch of the project.
- In a git repository, the main branch often represents the “production” version of the product being built
