# Story Outline

**Summary of the Adventure**

Jake Addison, a 12-year-old boy, from Grapefield, Wisconsin, is plagued with academic struggles, social challenges, and issues at home. His life changes forever, when, after getting into a fight in school, he decides to abandon class early. An accidental wrong turn tumbles him into the midst of a war based in a galaxy millions of light years away whose culture worships a mysterious force, _The Utma_, which is believed to guide how all beings learn, love, and create.

The story follows Jake through a series of adventures that span North America and Africa. On these escapades Jake is introduced to coding, combat (by learning certain computer science lessons, Jake gains fighting abilities), and the essence of this new galaxy's learning oriented culture. After fighting off alien foes, and meeting interesting contacts from across the universe, including Dendro, a Solar Forces warrior, Jake is transformed; he has an entirely new perspective on how to live life and how to think about learning.
