**Tip Example**

> "I once spent 8 hours debugging a file that had nothing wrong with it. I was in such a rush, my brain completely missed I was executing the wrong file name on the command line. The moral of the story: always practice patience when learning a new topic. Your mind will relax and the small details you would ordinarily miss will be absorbed by your brain faster (ultimately speeding up your ability to learn a new topic successfully)." – Steven Reubenstone, New York

##### Tip 2

Being a new programmer in the development field, it is often difficult to figure out things on our own and its perfectly fine. If you are stuck somewhere make sure you ask someone. In the age of internet help is abundant all you need to do is ask. As a new programmer myself, in the initial stages, I used to get too shy and it was scary for me to ask thinking, "What if I asked a really dumb question or what if I look like an idiot". TBH, it does not matter just ask, if a person whom you are asking the question is geniune she/he would definitely help if they laugh, you can always guess the toothpaste they use XD. - Sai Prasad, Bhubaneswar, India.

##### Tip 3

Always try learning by doing - I've seen a lot of people, early stage learners, who mug up the program and then try to write the program from their memory. Remember programming is like an art and is meant to solve a problem. There are 'n' different ways to solve a problem and no two solutions can be exactly similar unless you copy paste it. Take reference from the available resources and try to come up with your own logic and trust me the dopamine shot you get after you see your logic working, nothing in the world can match that for sure. You can always start off with some very simple but annoying problem from your daily life to come up with small program. For example I used to stick with my computer till late night and sleep while working on it but the computer used to run for all night. I needed a program where I could just schedule a time and make the computer shutdown with a prompt before shutting down, just in case I'm still awake. So to achieve this I wrote a small program in Java and Swing. It was really fun and I use it till now. I wrote the program in 2016. - Sai Prasad, India.
