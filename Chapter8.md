## CHAPTER 8

#### THERE’S DEFINITELY COMPANY

Jake had never run this fast. As his feet cut through the snow-covered road he searched for a pickup truck. Dendro said he couldn’t miss it.

Fifty feet ahead, he saw the four-wheeler parked in the driveway of a broken down cabin. He raced up to it, pulled open the door and confirmed that the keys were in the cup holder. _How could Dendro’s Radar know the keys were here?_

He had to find something heavy; something he could use to hold down the gas pedal. He shut the car door and sprinted to the back of the property. It was a small lot, and as he searched the ground hoping to find a stone, he heard running water coming from the trees. Seeing nothing of use in the grass, he trekked into the woods and stumbled upon a small stream. A few large rocks were immersed in the current. He picked a heavy one up from the shallow water. _This will do_.

He sat down in the driver's seat and carefully put the weighty stone down on the floor next to his feet. Now was the first real challenge. He had never driven anything besides a go-kart before. _How hard can this be?_ He put the key in the ignition and turned. The engine revved to life. _That worked._

_Reverse, where are you?_ He found the transmission lever and shifted it to _R_. As he gently placed his foot on the gas, he kept his head focused on the road directly behind him. The truck rolled backward, and a moment later he had successfully brought the truck onto the street.

He looked out onto the dark road from which he came. This was a kooky plan, and it had no guarantee of success. But it was what the Special Operative soldier told him to do, and he didn’t have anything better up his sleeve. He tried to remove the thoughts of being ripped apart by pernicious aliens from his mind.

“Here goes nothing,” Jake muttered. He swiveled the transmission into neutral as he kept his foot on the brake, then he reached down and carefully moved the stone onto the gas pedal.

_Vrr vrrr vrooooooooooooom! Vrooooooooooooom!_

The engine roared, but the stone seemed stable. _Seems like it will hold._ Jake cracked the driver’s side door ajar, and then took his foot off the brake. _We’re moving._ The car rolled forward slowly, still in neutral. _Here comes the hard part._ He swung his legs out of the vehicle, with his arms still on the wheel. _I can do this. But I need to roll out quickly._ He set the transmission into drive, and the car immediately jolted forward. _Oh man, this is faster than I thought!_ He felt the whiplash in his neck as he accelerated down the street in the hulking container of aluminum and steel. _Wait. Wait. Wait. Now!_

He threw his body out of the car, smashed into the Earth, and rolled over on the pavement a few times.

_Holy moly_. As the truck accelerated, he saw the barn ignite. Dendro had commenced his plan. Jake wrapped his arms around his knees and tried to calm himself. The goal was to distract at least a few of the Venthum troopers in the battalion with the burning barn. The truck’s heat signature was designed to confuse the Venthum team, so that the troopers would run away from the burning structure, back onto the street, to examine the oncoming threat. This created a ripe time for Dendro to strike.

Jake watched the car maintain a nearly perfect line towards its target. Just as Dendro had anticipated, two battle-plated figures ran from the barn perimeter, to see what they sensed hurling down the street. _Holy smokes! This can’t be real._ The alien soldiers shuffled into a practiced battle formation in the middle of the road, their laser aimed at the incoming target. _They must be seven or eight feet tall!_ Jake thought. The creatures wore silver metal helmets on their heads, and to Jake’s horror, their knee joints angled backwards like the legs of a dog. A jolt of nausea ran through him.

There was a cracking noise from the barn's roof as the shingles broke from the building. Jake spotted Dendro’s golden axe dancing through the air. The troopers attempted to turn around, but it was too late. Their lasers blasted in a chaotic symphony, but the axe smashed into the face of the nearest fighter with a hideous thump. Jake heard a wail. The truck was closing in. As the vehicle approached them, Dendro dove left. The remaining fighter dove right, just off the path.

An instant later, after the truck had zoomed past them, Dendro stood up, yelled, and ran at his opponent, axe raised. The creature charged, but it appeared to have lost its laser on the ground during the fall. Instead of searching for it, unsheathed a long thin blade from its belt. Dendro dug his heels into the ground and began to circle his foe. The two aliens shadowed each other as they sized each other up for some ten seconds, until Dendro feinted left. The fighter went for it. Dendro spun right, his axe swirling around with him like a golden serpent, and came down around the torso of the enemy. As the creature fell to its crooked knees, Jake heard it moan. Then Dendro thrust a blade he kept in his belt-buckle in the forehead of the creature and it collapsed with a grotesque squeal.

Jake shivered as he approached the scene. He glanced at two alien corpses lying face down on the ground. _Yeah, they’re definitely dead._ Dendro signaled him to step closer. The warrior appeared unharmed.

“That was the easy part, I’m sorry to say,” Dendro said as he fixed his robe. “We must head through the forest and regroup near the mountain. Let’s go!”

They hurled side by side through the woods that ran adjacent to the forest road.

_Chute-chute. Chute-chute. Chute-chute._ Thirty feet into the brush, red laser beams exploded into the top of the tree next to Jake. _What the…?_ He turned around and saw two tall battle-plated figures about a hundred feet behind them, lasers in hand, and closing in fast.

“What do we do!?” Jake yelled.

“Keep moving!” Dendro yelled. “Whatever you do, don’t stop, kid!”

Jake, amped by fear, ran as fast as he could. Sweat poured down his back, and his legs burned. In his desperation, he considered veering off into the woods. _They will sniff me out._

Laser beams hit another tree in front of him. A puff of smoke filled in the air.

“Where the heck is the mountain?!” Jake cried.

“We’re nearly there!” Dendro shouted.

Fifty feet ahead the forest opened, not far from the gate in the road that he had passed earlier. Jake spotted the main ski lodge two hundred feet ahead of him. Dendro sprinted towards it.

The warrior glanced at his glowing Lithium Radar as they sprinted up to the structure. “Get inside! Left hallway! Get somewhere cold! Where they can’t track you. There’s a maintenance room, a refrigerator. Go!!”

“Wait!” Jake screamed.

“GET IN THERE! GO!” Dendro yelled.

Jake hustled up to the main door of the lodge, gasping for air, as Dendro sprinted down the path and around the building out of sight. _I gotta hide_. _Where is Dendro going to go?! What’s his plan!?_ He turned the knob. It was locked.

Out of pure instinct, he plowed his body into the side window of the lodge. It was an effective cannonball-like movement, and the window shattered. He felt no meaningful pain. It was either the adrenaline or the robe must have somehow protected him. He ran to the hallway to the left.

_Maintenance room, maintenance room, where are you? Where are you!?_ He passed a bunch of guest room doors. He kept running. More guest room doors. _C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. Dendro said you’d be here._ He passed an ice machine, then spotted a sign that read “MAINTENANCE” on the top center. _There it is._ The door was unlocked. He entered. It was a small room, with a set of shelves and cabinets. He noticed a refrigerator in the back left corner that was still plugged into the wall.

He heard another window smash open.

_They’re here._

He opened the fridge, pulled out the refrigerator shelves, tucked them under the table, and slid his body inside. He closed the door tight. The freezing air enveloped him. _This is cold._

_Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump._

He heard heavy footsteps walking down the hall. _Oh, heavens, please. Please, let them pass this room._ His heart pounded so hard he thought that alone might kill him. _Is this how it all ends? Will they abduct me and transport me to some distant galaxy, perform experiments on me and dissect my body?_

He nudged the fridge door open ever so slightly. He peeped through the narrow slot of vision. He could see a faint light flickering from under the door. Troopers were shuffling down the hall in formation. As Jake held his breath, his mind shifted to the night not so long ago when he played video games and ate pizza with his brother.

The troopers passed the maintenance room and continued moving.

Jake felt a wave of relief.

But the troopers returned ten seconds later.

To Jake's horror, the maintenance door began to creak open, slowly.

Jake pulled the refrigerator shut, tensed his body, and prayed for his safety.

They were in the room. He could hear the battle trooper footsteps click-clacking across the floor. He decided the only thing left to do besides pray was to pull on the fridge door, in case one of the aliens tried to open it.

He heard pots and pans crashing on the ground. Items on the shelves shuffled. Drawers opened. Things rattled.

There was a tap on the fridge.

He felt the pulling pressure on the door of the refrigerator, but it was not strong, likely because they sensed no heat signature behind the door. Then it pulled harder. Jake pulled backwards as hard as he could, desperate to keep the refrigerator door shut. No additional tugs came. He heard more shuffling. The footsteps faded. The soldiers had left the room.

Jake stayed in the fridge, his teeth chattering. He kept his ear on the door, listening for any potential threats.

A few minutes later, he opened the fridge cautiously, silently. He tiptoed to the maintenance room door. His back against the wall, he opened the door slowly. There were no signs of anything living.

He decided he had no option but to get back outside and try and find Dendro. He walked down the hall and entered the unoccupied lobby of the lodge. The front door was busted open. He peeked outside and spotted strange footprints in the snow. They led out away from the central lodging area towards the open valley.

Five hundred feet away, in the center of the field were two dark figures, and they appeared to be holding their hands to their helmets. The subtle red glow from their laser cannons was visible.

_They are still hunting us_, Jake thought. _Dendro was right. There is no running._ There was no sign of the Naronian warrior. He was not sure what to do. He kept his eyes on the receding fighters, who clearly did not know where he or Dendro were. Jake had a feeling that was going to change pretty fast. Luck was only going to take them so far.

“COME AND GET ME YOU VENTHUM RODENTS!” a voice shouted from the forest. Jake looked back at the woods. _Dendro went back in? Was that his idea all along?_ He caught sight of the Venthum battle troopers turning around. He crouched, tiptoed back into the lodge, and dipped down below the window. Thirty seconds later he heard footsteps jogging through the snow. _They're going to find Dendro._ He waited until the troopers disappeared into the forest before he got up, then headed back onto the forest road.

Soon after he entered the forest, two giant hands wrapped around his mouth and pulled him off the path. _What the heck?_

“Relax. It's me,” Dendro whispered. “I must take them on the rink. It is our best chance. But this time, there will be no distractions or decoys to take advantage of,” Dendro said. “It will be a dog fight.” He pulled open his Solar Forces robe and pulled out a silver axe that Jake had not seen before. It was similar in shape to his own, but smaller. He spun it once in his hands, the metal catching silver rays of the moonlight, then handed it to Jake.

“This is for me?” Jake asked, stunned.

Dendro nodded. “In case things go south, you will be armed.” Dendro unsheathed his golden axe. “The rink will give us our best chance to defeat them. It will reduce heat signature tracking, which affects weapon guidance at both close and long range.” Dendro spun his axe around in his hand. “Stay behind the walls. Do not get on the ice. Our best hope is that I fight them off, axe to sword, with everything I've got. Use the axe only if necessary. Stay hidden.” Dendro walked ahead.

“Wait!” Jake said. “I don’t even know how to use this thing.”

But Dendro was moving towards the rink with a determined stride. Jake shook his head as he held the axe in his hands. _That guy,_ Jake thought.

He had no option but to follow behind him. He crouched down and walked slowly around the side of the rink perimeter, as Dendro hurtled over the rink wall. Jake peeped his head up a moment later as he became in line with the rink center. _Where are the troopers?_

Dendro casually strutted to the center of the ice. _What’s he doing?_

A moment later, Dendro cocked his head towards the sky and yelled, “COME AND GET ME!” His right arm brought the axe up to his hip, and hands let go. The glowing weapon remained in the air by his side, like a faithful servant. Then three laser beams locked onto Dendro. They were coming from the woods beyond the far edge of the rink. Jake felt sick again. To his amazement, the top edge of Dendro’s axe lit up with a blue hue. Dendro gripped onto the floating weapon with a two-handed grip. An instant later, rapid fire, three-pulse laser sequences followed each other in rapid succession at their target.

“Oh, my goodness,” Jake muttered. Dendro swirled his axe through the air, deflecting the laser pulses with superhuman swiftness. The defense almost looked easy for him. The laser-pulse deflecting hand eye coordination was not from an Earthly realm. The speed. The reaction time. The angle of attack. The grace of the footwork. It was all too much to comprehend, but it was remarkable to watch. And even in this life-or-death situation, Dendro’s facial expression was calm and self-assured.

Two troopers exited the trees and traversed slowly across the dirt in a practiced battle formation, the two bodies angled away from one another to increase their visual coverage. They continued their laser fire, and Dendro continued his graceful parries. They approached the rink wall, hurtled in single file onto the ice.

A few feet into the rink they broke out of their formation. One trooper moved slowly towards Dendro’s left, the other towards his right. Jake could see the troopers' form in greater detail. For one, they were mightily tall, _at least_ two feet taller than Dendro. They wore large circular shields on their chests. The shoulder plates were silver, and so were their long downward sloping helmets. The backward curving legs were an even more terrible sight up close. The faces were hard to make out in this light, but Jake caught glimpses of scarred, stretched skin, and tiny red eyes.

Jake remained crouched with his head peering just over the rink’s ledge. To Jake's surprise, the two fighters holstered their lasers and proceeded to take out two long, red-glowing swords. They locked in on Dendro.

_Oh, no,_ Jake thought.

The first trooper moved with lethal grace. It closed the distance between itself and Dendro in a matter of seconds. It carried its red blade in its hands, but Dendro stood his ground. The weapon came down quickly, aimed at Dendro’s left shoulder, but it was not thrown at full force, as if it was meant purely to test Dendro's reaction time. Dendro met the blade mid-way through its arc with his mighty axe. The fighter took a half step back then came forward with a series of rapid, short winding slashes. Dendro danced away from them, parrying each slash with relative ease.

The second Venthum fighter entered the death tango from Dendro’s right, throwing small, fencing-like jabs at Dendro, as the first fighter threw more powerful, longer arced slashes. Dendro danced once again, this time using his axe to counter both of his opponents’ blows. The second fighter initiated a set of more forceful slashes. Dendro was a skilled, acrobatic fighter, but facing two formidable foes at the same time put him at a disadvantage. He deflected the trooper’s blows upward and to the side with blinding speed. The troopers continued to back him up, slowly.

_They want to exhaust him,_ Jake thought.

Then a series of rapid-paced offensive exchanges pushed them back off from one another. That’s when Dendro got on his knees for an instant, brought his two hands together next to his face, as if he were praying, then did something unbelievable. _What the…?_

He cocked his legs and flipped high in the air over the two troopers. On his way down, he slashed his axe down on the protruding legs of his rightmost opponent. The creature tumbled backward and let off a demented howl. But it was not dead. It stood back up, limping severely, liquid oozing from its skin.

As Dendro turned around, a confident grin appeared on his face. He knew he had an opportunity to make this fight one on one.

“I WILL BREAK YOU!” Dendro roared. He glanced at his injured opponent, then darted forward at the healthy one; his eyes glared with a determination of undeterrable will. A moment later, he met the glowing sword of his healthy foe with a sequence of heavy blows, which caused his opponent to take a few steps backwards on the ice. It was enough space to let him do what he did next: back flip in front of the injured foe fifteen feet behind him. His feet landed silently, and the axe came down with tremendous speed, knocking the blade from his opponent's grip. The creature’s face wore a look of frightened surprise. Then Dendro's weapon sailed back around through the night air and cut through the creature's torso. It moaned as its body crumpled onto the ice. A few moments later, the healthy trooper walked up to its dying comrade as Dendro shuffled backwards to the edge of the rink.

After exchanging some indiscernible words, the healthy Venthum trooper pulled its glowing sword over the injured fighter and slung it deep into his comrade’s neck. There was a sizzling of smoke and the fighter's eyes closed shut.

_That’s sick_, Jake thought.

The healthy fighter brought his attention back to Dendro and the dance began once again. Dendro skated on his boots to the center of the rink and met his foe blade to blade, the glowing metal weapons creating a malevolent light show that only Jake was present to witness. Dendro appeared to be a drop slower. He had used his freakish acrobatics to fend off the two foes, even killing one, but he was fatigued. The trooper pushed Dendro back with a few sharp, sweeping jabs of the long blade.

The interchange of slashes continued on for a few moments. Then Dendro sidestepped and feinted to his right, but the fighter read his opponent and used the split second advantage to slash down hard at Dendro’s exposed left shoulder. The sword came down and dug a few inches into Dendro’s flesh. Dendro let out a terrible yell.

A pain seared through Jake’s gut. He could see the blood seeping out of Dendro’s robe as the warrior fell back from his opponent. _I can’t just stand here. I have to do something._

Jake picked up the silver axe and held it in his hands.

He looked on as the trooper began to attack the Solar Forces soldier without mercy. Each time the lethal sword came down, Dendro somehow managed to meet the blow with his axe. Yet each time he defended himself, his energy seemed to dissipate. If this continued, Dendro would not survive, and Jake was going to get sniffed out by the Venthum. _I have to act._

His mother and brother flashed through his mind again, but he had no more time. He had to make a decision. Would he fight or flee?

He flipped the axe around in his hand, then brought the weapon down by the side of his hip. He noticed the top edge had begun to shine blue. _That is surreal._ He was skeptical of this mysterious Utma force, even if he had seen some of Dendro’s powers in action. He let go of the axe, expecting it to fall to the ground, but it did not. The heavy weapon remained in place, floating in the air beside him, gently spinning forward, a levitating object somehow bound to him, defying the known laws of gravity. _Zegmu._

_Oh. My. Goodness. It’s freaking floating._ He continued to watch his axe gently spinning next to him. He thought of the code on Dendro’s computer for an instant, then he put his two hands back on the axe and gripped onto it. He felt his mind calm. He looked back to the rink. _Maybe this is a sign that I must fight. This is proof there is something different inside of me._ He brought the axe closer to his heart and hopped over the ledge of the rink.

Dendro turned towards him. “Jake. No, son. Go back. Run while you still can. I will fight them off,” the injured warrior pleaded.

Jake ignored him. He knew what he had to do.

As he approached the Venthum fighter, he didn’t feel like prey any longer. Something aided his step, something hidden, something deep. When the trooper turned its attention towards Jake, Dendro charged the enemy with all the strength he had left, but the fighter easily sidestepped the attack, spun, and delivered a forceful kick to Dendro’s head. Dendro fell over and skidded down the rink.

Jake marched towards the creature. He had to divert its attention from Dendro. The enemy turned its head and moved swiftly towards Jake. The imposing creature’s red eyes, curved helmet, and mutilated skin stood in front of him and his blade came down at Jake incredibly fast. Jake had barely enough time to meet his opponent’s weapon with his axe.

Jake stumbled backward as the painful shock wave of the collision ran through his arms and elbows. His wrists and shoulders went numb.

The Venthum fighter closed in on him.

_Five feet._

Jake continued to backpedal.

_Three feet._

Was he about to die?

He felt an electric sensation run up his feet, as if he had stepped on an exposed power line. His legs rattled. He felt paralyzing pain. _What...what is happening…to…me._ His legs almost gave in as they vibrated, but an instant later the pain stopped, and the sensation transformed into something almost pleasant. A warm, soothing, sensation started in his legs, then ran up his torso, arms, and the rest of his upper body.

_What the heck?_

His hands weren't numb anymore.

Strange-looking characters moved across his vision as if some alien language was speaking to him from out of the void. The solid blue hue emitted from the top of his axe began to pulse, as if it were loading something: data or something more profound. Jake felt a euphoric wave pulsate through his body, and his eyes were forced shut. When he reopened them, he wasn’t Jake Addison any longer, at least not the Jake Addison he knew.

He approached his red-eyed opponent once again and met the Venthum sword mid-way through its arc with his silver axe. This time there was no vibrational shock. Then his axe moved in perfect rhythm, as if his moves had been rehearsed.

Slash left, side step, parry, uppercut right, parry, Jake handed blow after blow, slash after slash, with powerful grace and elite form. He had now backed the eight-foot tall Venthum fighter up the rink. They almost appeared evenly matched now, blow for blow.

Jake had never used his body like this before: the agility, the control of his balance, the delicate interpretation of his planes of momentum. He was pure agility. He was a force. It felt like he sensed his opponent’s movements before they happened. He backed up the fighter another few feet up the rink. Then he circled him. He was in control. They exchanged another flurry of slashes. The fighter’s face contorted in frustration, then it charged him and sprung into the air with its blade held high above its head.

Jake backed up, with his axe held up high. But midway through its arc, a golden axe cut straight through the creature’s torso from behind. The creature’s body twisted backwards as it gave off a terrible shriek. Blood sprayed from the wound as the axe retracted. The Venthum fighter fell, dead. Its blood soaked the ice.

Dendro stood behind the trooper’s body gripping his bloody golden axe. He peered at Jake, sizing him up. “How did you do that, son?” Dendro asked incredulously. The patch of blood above his shoulder had grown larger. He appeared to be seriously wounded.

Jake looked down at his axe, but the top edge was no longer pulsating. “I don’t know. I felt something. I saw marks. I don’t know… It wasn’t me.” The golden rays of dawn broke over the top of the forest trees.

Dendro stared at him. “I do not understand. I watched. To achieve _foresight_...that is not possible,” Dendro muttered. “Years of training are required. Even then, it is not guaranteed. Took me a decade.” He looked to the ground as if he were thinking deeply. Then his yellow eyes locked onto Jake. “To be wisest is to admit we know nothing. Nothing at all. We’ll discuss this more later,” Dendro said, grimacing as he felt his shoulder. “Let’s get out of here!”

“But can you fly with that wound?” Jake asked.

“I will do what I can,” Dendro replied.

They hustled down the forest road, passing the smoking truck which had lodged itself into a large tree. They soon reached the burnt barn facility, passing by the dead aliens lying face down on the ground, and headed to the ship.

Dendro sat in his cockpit seat and pulled off his robe. His wound went deep, at least three inches into the flesh. Jake could see bone. Dendro pulled out a turquoise patch from a kit near his feet and placed it on the laceration. It tightened around the injured muscle.

“That’ll have to do. It will stop the spread of infection and keep the wound closed, but I must get medical help.” Dendro’s face tightened as he pulled the robe back over his shoulder. “If we depart now, we can get to Casablanca in under four hours,” Dendro said. “Give us a few days to regroup in Morocco, understand what's going on across The Nestomir, and gather whatever intel we can from Zimmer. Then hopefully, we can get you home. Now, hang your axe on the wall next to mine.”

A few moments later, they ascended over the canopy of the forest. The abandoned resort grew smaller, and smaller, until it was hard to discern one structure from another. The vertical thrusters powered off and the main engines powered on and then they began moving fast towards the sun. East. Towards Morocco.
